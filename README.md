# UAT_NEXT_BLAZE_FRAMEWORK
Automated UI testing framework for the NEXT Blaze application. This Maven-based TestNG framework uses Selenium WebDriver to execute test suites, produces HTML test reports and integrates with GitHub Actions for CI runs.

---
## Technology Stack
Java 21, Maven, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, ExtentReports (reporting), GitHub Actions (CI)

---
## Prerequisites
- Java JDK 21 installed and JAVA_HOME configured
- Maven installed (mvn available)
- Git (optional, for cloning)
- Browser driver(s) — WebDriverManager is used in the project where configured

---
## Quick Start

**1. Clone the repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/mayukhpursuit/UAT_NEXTNEXT_BLAZE_FRAMEWORK_AUTO.git
```

**2. Navigate to project root**

**3. Run tests (example)**

You can run your automation suite directly using Maven with parameters for suite file, log file name, browser, and execution mode.

Syntax:
```
mvn clean test "-DsuiteXmlFile=TestRun_XML/your_XML_File_Name.xml" "-DlogFileName=Your_Log_File_Name" "-Dbrowser=chrome" "-Dmode=headlessOrHeaded"
```

Examples:

Run the complete UAT test Cases in headed Chrome mode:
```
mvn clean test "-DsuiteXmlFile=TestRun_XML/main.xml" "-DlogFileName=UAT_Log" "-Dbrowser=chrome" "-Dmode=headed"
```

Run author tests in headless mode:
```
mvn clean test "-DsuiteXmlFile=TestRun_XML/authortest.xml" "-DlogFileName=Author_Log" "-Dbrowser=chrome" "-Dmode=headless"
```

**Notes:**
- The suite files are available under `TestRun_XML/` (e.g. `testplan.xml`, `authortest.xml`, `executetest.xml`).
- Maven passes the suite file to surefire using the `-DsuiteXmlFile` parameter, which is read in the project's configuration.
- The -Dbrowser parameter can be chrome, firefox, or any browser configured in your framework.
- The -Dmode parameter controls UI visibility — use headless for CI/CD pipelines.
- The logs will be stored under the logs/ directory using the given log file name.

## CI / GitHub Actions

This repository contains a workflow **`CI - Run TestNG Suites with Maven`** located at `.github/workflows/maven-ci.yml`.  

The workflow can be triggered in the following ways:

### 1. On Push
The workflow is automatically triggered when there is a push to the `main` branch (or any configured branches).

### 2. Manual Trigger (Workflow Dispatch)
You can trigger the workflow manually from the GitHub UI:
1. Go to the repository **Actions** tab.  
2. Select **CI - Run TestNG Suites with Maven**.  
3. Click **Run workflow** and choose the branch/suite inputs if any.  

### 3. Programmatically
You can also trigger runs programmatically using the **GitHub Actions REST API** by dispatching the workflow file.

## Reports and Artifacts
After a test run, reports and artifacts are available in these locations within the repository workspace:
- reports/ (HTML reports and screenshots)
- target/ (compiled classes and surefire/target outputs)

Screenshots taken during failures are stored under `screenshots/` and additional HTML reports are in `reports/`.

---
## Project Structure (high level)
- `src/test/java/` — Test cases and test utilities (TestNG test classes).
- `reports/` — Generated HTML test reports and logs.
- `screenshots/` — Failure screenshots captured during tests.
- `pom.xml` — Maven project file (dependencies and plugins).
- `.github/workflows/maven-ci.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow for CI.

| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DataProviders/** | Contains TestNG DataProvider classes for modular test data supply to each suite (Author, Execute, Requirement, TestPlan).                                         |
| **pageObjects/**   | Implements Page Object Model — each tab has its own subfolder defining web elements and methods to interact with that page.                                       |
| **testBase/**      | Core setup and teardown logic. Handles WebDriver initialization, configuration loading, and environment setup.                                                    |
| **testCases/**     | Main automation test scripts, grouped by module (author, execute, requirement, test plan). Each test case class references `BaseClass` and relevant Page Objects. |
| **resources/**     | Holds configuration files such as `config.properties` (URLs, credentials, environment variables) and `log4j2.xml` (logging setup).                                |
| **testData/**      | Stores external test data files organized per module (can include Excel, CSV, or JSON files).                                                                     |
| **target/**        | Auto-generated by Maven after each build. Contains compiled code, reports, and logs.                                                                              |
| **TestRun_XML/**   | (At project root) Contains TestNG suite files (`testplan.xml`, `authortest.xml`, etc.) which define the execution flow for different modules.                     |

## How to add or run a new TestNG suite locally
1. Create or modify a suite file in `TestRun_XML/` (e.g. `new-suite.xml`).
2. Run it with Maven:

```
mvn clean test "-DsuiteXmlFile=TestRun_XML/your_XML_File_Name.xml" "-DlogFileName=Your_Log_File_Name" "-Dbrowser=chrome" "-Dmode=headlessOrHeaded"

```

---
## Common Troubleshooting
- **Headless issues (X11/HeadlessException)**: If you see `HeadlessException` when running UI tests on a server, ensure runs are configured for headless mode (set browser options) or use containers/VMs with display support (Xvfb) or run with a headful runner locally.
- **Driver/version issues**: Ensure the browser and driver versions are compatible. Consider using WebDriverManager to auto-manage drivers.
- **Missing environment variables**: Set `JAVA_HOME` and ensure `mvn` is on PATH.
